                <p>Only 10 metres from Alemanes Beach, Hotel Finch Bay offers rooms with free Wi-Fi and air conditioning in Puerto Ayora, in Galapagos Island. It features a swimming pool and a restaurant, as well as a pier with yachts to visit the islands. The city centre is 3 km away.
                    Decorated with tiled and stylish furnishing, rooms at Finch Bay are very bright. All of them have private bathrooms, and some boast private balconies with sea views and hammocks.
                    Breakfast with bacon, sausages, pancakes, fresh fruits and eggs is served daily. Regional and Asian dishes can be ordered at the propertyâ€™s restaurant, as well as original chef-designed dishes. Drinks and snacks from the bar can be enjoyed by the pool.</p>
                <p>Guests can sunbathe on the beach or sail away on one of the private yachts moored in the pier. Snorkeling and kayaking can be practiced at a fee, and bikes can be rented to explore the island.

                    <p class="reviewText">Finch Bay gives those of us with seasickness a way to see Santa Cruz, and three additional islands, all while sleeping in very comfortable on-land rooms at night. Hotel itself is very pretty, on a fairly busy beach, and service/food was impeccable.</p>

                    <p class="reviewText">The pool and pool bar are the highlight of this hotel. They are beautiful, tranquil and close to nature. The food and service at this hotel is also excellent, staff were friendly and breakfast delicious. The only problem for us was the rooms, they are pretty basic - not as luxurious as I would expect for the price.</p>
