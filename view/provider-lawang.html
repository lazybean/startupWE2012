				<p class="title">Description</p>
                <p>Situated around 90 km north-west of Medan along the clear Bohorok River and on the outskirts of the tropical rainforest, Bukit Lawang is known for the largest animal sanctuary of Sumatran orangutans. In 1973 a Swiss organisation founded an orangutan rehabilitation centre in Bukit Lawang. The main purpose was to preserve the decreasing number of orangutan population due to hunting, trading and deforestation and to rehabilitate the great apes released from captivity. The rangers at the centre teached the orangutans all the necessary skills to survive in the wild. After a period of quarantine, readjustment to the natural habitat and reintegration in the wild population, the orangutan got released back into the jungle. Although the rehabilitation centre has not operated since many years, all orangutans released are still focused by the rangers of the national park. Two times a day visitors now are allowed to join semi-wild orangutans while getting provided with supplementary food at the feeding platform. While guided trekking through the dense tropical rainforest there, you can also spot wild orangutans and a variety of other wildlife. </p>

                    <p class="reviewText">A friend and I recently completed (October 2012) the Dream In the Rainforest 4 Day Tour in Sumatra. This tour, tour leader, and overall experience was fantastic and I would highly recommend doing it. The tour consisted of a trek in the rainforest (I'm not particularly fit but had no problems with this). We saw Orangutans and various Monkeys, we also saw a Monitor Lizard!</p>

                    <p class="reviewText">We stayed in sumatra for one week in october 2012 with eco travel: bukit lawang and pulau weh. Everything was well arranged: car/bus rides,guides,accommodations,information! Only with the night bus from Binjai to Banda Aceh we heard there were some problems but for us only that the departure was late.taking a flight is not a bad option.</p>
